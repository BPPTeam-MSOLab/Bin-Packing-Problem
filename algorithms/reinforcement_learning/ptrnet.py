"""
We implement Pointer Networks (PtrNet) using PyTorch.
- PtrNet is a neural network architecture that extends the sequence-to-sequence model.
- This architecture is designed to solve problems where the output is a permutation of the input.
- In Bin Packing Problem, PtrNet can be used to determine the order of items to be packed in bins.
